# WeatherApp
aka: Just another coding challenge

## About The Project
Weather application built using the `https://open-meteo.com/` API.

This android app showcases the weather forecast for the next seven days. It first fetches the data for the location of the user, but it also offers a search functionality to look for the weather in any other city in the world.

I have decided to use Jetpack Compose as it is much more fun than XML. The whole project is build using MVVM and it has three layers.
- Presentation
- Domain
- Data
